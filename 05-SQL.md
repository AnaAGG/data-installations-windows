# 5. SQL

**5.1. Installation**

To install mySQL in our computer we will need to install two differents programs: 

- **5.5.1 SQL Server**  

    In the terminal: 

        sudo apt update sudo apt install mysql-server
        sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start # to elevate the server
    ⚠️ When you run this last code you will get a warning in the terminal. Nothing happens, we can continue working ⚠️ 

- **5.5.2 Workbench**   
    To install Workbench we should open our browser and go to the mySQL [website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
